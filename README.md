# TicTacToe_Drawing

This project was completed in 2021. I am aware of too many comments in code and Polish language, but wasn't experienced in code documentation :)

Project is about simple TicTacToe game with minimax optimized movements. Appliaction GUI (written in Tkinter) allows user to draw game board and symbols, which are interpreted and used in computer movments. The game is fun to play (but don't expect to win, rather try not to lose :D)

It looks like this:
